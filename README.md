Areas for Improvement
-------------

Ideas for future development:

* Update app to support landscape orientation (for iPhone) and portrait (for iPad)
* Switch from javascript charting to CorePlot-based charting
* Allow user to switch between a list of all rides and a list of only his/her own rides, or club rides
* Add ability to drill into ride segments
